## Building

You'll need the following dependencies:

```
ruby-full
build-essential
zlib1g-dev
```

We recommend installing gems to a (hidden) directory in your home folder:

```sh
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/.gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install bundler:

```sh
gem install bundler
```

Install gems:

```sh
bundle install
```

Build and serve locally with:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

The site should now be available at http://0.0.0.0:4000/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.

### Updating Data

`_data/repos.json` is automatically rebuilt from a GitHub Action, but you can build it for local development:

First, create a [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` permissions and copy it somewhere safe.

Then, make sure you have `pip` and `PyGithub`. On elementary OS:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install PyGithub
```

Lastly, run `release.py` re-using your token as an environment variable, e.g.:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ python3 release.py
```
